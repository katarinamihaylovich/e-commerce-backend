# e-commerce-backend

## Description

The purpose of this project was to present the back end of an e-commerce website which would enable a user to read, create, update, and delete items in the store's database. After being given starter code, I wanted to enhance the database functionality via API routes so that the user would be able to keep their information organized. I did this through the use of Express, MySQL, and Sequelize. With the help of these technologies (and Insomnia for testing), a user is able to do the following:

1. Read data (all or by ID) by searching /api/categories, /api/tags, and /api/products.
2. Create data through /api/categories, /api/tags, and /api/products.
3. Update data through /api/categories, /api/tags, and /api/products.
4. Delete data through /api/categories, /api/tags, and /api/products.

I accomplished most of this by creating API routes (in the routes folder) for all of the look-up methods (categories, tags, products), and that was a big learning experience. I also accomplished this project through the use of Models by defining them and creating constraints and validations. I also reinforced my own knowledge of seeding a schema, creating connections, APIs, and using the dotenv package.
